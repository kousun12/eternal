Seemingly complex phenomena which have succinct descriptions are especially beautiful to me. This project is one which allows one to describe audio/visual processes as programs, represented as a visual graph.\n\n--\n\nmost actions are invoked via keyboard commands. press \"shift + /\" (the question mark) for the menu.\n\nconnect nodes and edges to make your own eternal programs, or load some examples (alt + e)."},"title":"README"}],"edges":[]}
